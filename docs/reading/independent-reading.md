# Independent Reading

This section has a list of useful books to read on your own. Reading a translation side by side, where available, can be helpful. Some of these books also have accompanying audio to overcome the challenge of reading without tashkeel (vowel signs). These books will help you transition from guided reading to independent reading, insha Allah.

Please note that I am only sharing classical books and ISlamic literature on this site. If you want to practice reading Arabic through other contemporary books (like story books and modern text) you can join my Facebook group [Adventures in Arabic](https://www.facebook.com/groups/adventures.in.arabic/) where I share more contemporary resources.

!!! tip "This is a work in progress and I will keep adding new books/resources so please check back often."

## **التفسير الميسر**

_by a group of prominent scholars, initiative King Fahad Printing Press_

![al-Tafseer al-Muyassar](/img/tafseer-muyassar.jpg)

This tafseer is in simple Arabic, using only simple and easy phrases and words throughout the Tafseer, along with explaining the difficult words. The tafseer is simplified and summarized, from the works of the greatest Imaams of tafseer and explains the meaning of the ayaat directly, without quoting any narrations except where necessary. Which makes it a good starting book for the students of Arabic before delving into more complex books of tafseer.
