## How to use this pathway

Following this pathway is easy. On the left hand side menu you will see links to all the resources categorized into Beginner, Intermediate, Advance and Classics sections. Each section has a number of courses which should be completed in the order they occur.


!!! tip
    Each course has links to various resources. The compulsory resources include main text books, videos etc. There are also links to a number of optional study aids to help you master the concepts being taught in that course.

Depending on your level of understanding Arabic, choose a section and follow the courses.

## How to track and show your progress (Optional)

![Trello board](/img/trello.png)

Optionally, you can track and show your progress through our Trello board. The intention of this board is to provide for you a way to track your progress, and also the ability to show your progress through a public page to friends, family, fellow students, etc. You can change the status of your board to be public or private.

1. Create an account in [Trello.](https://trello.com/)
2. Copy [this board](https://trello.com/b/X9IeDKTe) to your personal account. See how to copy a board [here.](https://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally)
3. Now that you have a copy of my official board, you just need to pass the cards to the Doing column or Done column as you progress in your study.

However if you find using the board confusing or are not interested in using it for any reason, you can skip this step.


## Finding Help

Like with everything else, studying Arabic without a teacher or mentor to help you can become difficult at times. Especially if you have questions or are unable to understand a concept.

Luckily we live in an age where we can connect to lots of mentors and fellow students through social media and that is the next best thing to having a teacher.
